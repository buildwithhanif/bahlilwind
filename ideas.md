  **Design Movement**: Neo-Brutalism / "Sat-set" Aesthetics
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Raw & Direct**: High contrast, bold borders, unpolished but functional look that screams "developer tool".
  2. **High Energy**: Reflects the "sat-set" (fast/agile) slang with sharp transitions and snappy movements.
  3. **Playful & Irreverent**: Embraces the parody nature with quirky UI elements and slightly chaotic layouts.
  4. **Utility-First**: Content is king; the animations are the stars, not the container.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Electric Blue (#2563EB) - energetic, standard tech color but ramped up.
  - **Secondary**: Warning Yellow (#FACC15) - for "attention" animations and highlights.
  - **Background**: Stark White (#FFFFFF) or very light gray with heavy black borders.
  - **Intent**: To feel like a tool that gets out of your way but has a strong personality. "Sat-set" implies speed and efficiency, so high contrast helps readability.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Modular Grid**: Heavy use of bento-box style grids with thick black borders.
  - **Asymmetry**: Sections that break the grid to draw attention to key features (like the "Download" or "Copy" buttons).
  - **Sticky Elements**: Navigation and key CTAs stick aggressively to edges.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Thick Borders**: 2px-4px solid black borders on everything.
  - **Drop Shadows**: Hard, non-blurred drop shadows (box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px #000).
  - **Marquee Text**: Scrolling text for "Sat-set", "Bahlilwind", "Langsung Jalan".

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Tactile Feedback**: Buttons depress visibly (translate) on click.
  - **Hover Chaos**: Hovering over cards triggers the animations immediately and maybe slightly tilts the card.
  - **Instant Gratification**: Copying code gives a massive, satisfying "COPIED!" overlay.

  **Animation**:
  - **Snappy**: All UI transitions are fast (0.1s - 0.2s) with cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1).
  - **Jitter**: Subtle vibration on "attention" elements.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Space Grotesk' or 'Chakra Petch' - technical, slightly boxy, futuristic but brutal.
  - **Body**: 'JetBrains Mono' or 'Fira Code' - monospaced for everything, reinforcing the "code" aspect.

  **Design Movement**: Glassmorphism / "Politician" Sleek
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Transparency & Depth**: Layers of frosted glass representing the "transparency" (or lack thereof) in politics/tech.
  2. **Premium & Official**: Looks like a high-end campaign website or a serious enterprise product, making the parody funnier by contrast.
  3. **Fluidity**: Everything flows like wind ("wind" in Bahlilwind).
  4. **Trustworthy**: Clean lines, generous whitespace, professional veneer.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Deep Purple (#581C87) to Vibrant Violet (#8B5CF6) - regal, creative, "Tailwind-ish".
  - **Accent**: Teal/Cyan (#06B6D4) - representing the "wind" and freshness.
  - **Background**: Dark mode default with deep gradients (Midnight Blue to Purple).
  - **Intent**: To mimic the high-polish aesthetic of modern SaaS and political campaign sites.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Floating Cards**: Content floats in space on glass panels.
  - **Z-Axis Layering**: Heavy use of depth to separate content from background.
  - **Centered & Heroic**: Classic, strong centered typography for the hero section.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Frosted Glass**: Backdrop-filter: blur(12px) with white/10 opacity borders.
  - **Glows**: Soft, ambient glows behind active elements.
  - **Mesh Gradients**: Moving background gradients that look like wind currents.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Smooth & Elegant**: Hover effects are slow and easing.
  - **Spotlight**: Cursor moves a spotlight effect across cards.
  - **Parallax**: Scrolling moves background layers at different speeds.

  **Animation**:
  - **Fluid**: Easing is soft (ease-in-out), durations are longer (0.4s - 0.6s).
  - **Float**: Elements gently bob up and down when idle.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Clash Display' or 'Plus Jakarta Sans' - bold, modern, high x-height.
  - **Body**: 'Inter' or 'Satoshi' - clean, neutral, legible.

  **Design Movement**: Retro Indo-Pop / "Warteg" Cyberpunk
  **Core Principles**:
  1. **Local Flavor**: Visual cues from Indonesian street culture mixed with cyberpunk neon.
  2. **Nostalgic yet Modern**: Pixel art meets high-res gradients.
  3. **Community Focused**: Feels like a grassroots project, warm and inviting.
  4. **Eclectic**: A mix of patterns (batik-inspired digital patterns) and tech UI.

  **Color Philosophy**:
  - **Primary**: Warteg Orange (#F97316) and Gojek Green (#22C55E).
  - **Accent**: Neon Pink (#EC4899) for the "cyber" feel.
  - **Background**: Dark grey (#111827) with noise texture.
  - **Intent**: To ground the "Indonesian flavor" of the library in the visual identity itself.

  **Layout Paradigm**:
  - **Collage**: Elements overlap slightly, looking like posters on a wall.
  - **Sidebar Navigation**: Reminiscent of old documentation sites but stylized.
  - **Scroll-based Storytelling**: The page tells the story of "Bahlil" moving through the screen.

  **Signature Elements**:
  - **Halftone Patterns**: Dots and textures used for shading.
  - **Sticker UI**: Badges and tags look like stickers.
  - **Glitch Effects**: Subtle glitches on the logo and key headings.

  **Interaction Philosophy**:
  - **Playful**: Buttons might "bounce" or "wiggle" even before clicking.
  - **Gamified**: Clicking copy triggers a "score" or sound effect visual.

  **Animation**:
  - **Stepped**: Animations might use steps() timing function for a retro feel.
  - **Flashy**: High contrast flashes on interaction.

  **Typography System**:
  - **Headings**: 'Righteous' or 'VT323' - display fonts with character.
  - **Body**: 'DM Sans' - geometric and friendly.
